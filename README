Insilicut - in silico cutting of genomic DNA with restriction enzyme
====================================================================

This directory contains insilicut, a minimal package reporting fragments when
cutting in silico genomic DNA with one restriction enzyme. It is potentially
useful when planning a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) experiment (also known
as restriction-assisted DNA sequencing, RAD-seq).

The development of this package is funded by the Institut National de la
Recherche Agronomique (INRA). The copyright is owned by INRA. See the COPYING
file for usage permissions.

The content of this directory is versioned using git, the central repository
being hosted on GitHub:

Installation
============

Insilicut doesn't need any compilation as it only contains scripts. However, 
it still has a few requirements:
* Bash and Awk;
* PaTMaN (https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/patman/);
* Python (version >= 2.7 or 3.1);
* R (optional, version >= 2.15).

First, download the package, for instance:
    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/timflutre/insilicut/archive/master.zip
    unzip master; rm -f master; cd insilicut-master

Then, run the tests:
    make check

Finally, install the package:
    make install

By default everything is installed in a directory bin/ in ${HOME}. If the 
bin/ directory does not exist, it will be created. To install elsewhere, use 
the option INSTALL, for instance:
    make install INSTALL="/usr/local"


Documentation
=============

You can access the manual in command-line via:
    man ./doc/insilicut.man
